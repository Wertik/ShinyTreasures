# Particle options directly correspond to particle algorithms shown here: https://github.com/CryptoMorin/XSeries/blob/master/src/main/java/com/cryptomorin/xseries/particles/XParticle.java
# I created some kinda-working defaults. Play around with the values and you should be able to get solid particles done.
# Note: Some options take effect only on some types.

# Types: structured_cube, filled_cube, circle, lightning

# There are a lot of settings which do or do not take effect.
# I wasn't able to figure out how to get lightning to work. Good luck.
